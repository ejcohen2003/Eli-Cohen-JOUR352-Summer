    <strong>Journalist</strong><br>
   
    <p>I am a student journalist at the University of Maryland, and my main focus in journalism is sports writing. I have experience as a beat writer and with it, I’ve gained fluency in writing many types of stories and doing so on a deadline.</p>  
    <div id="sectionheader">Experience:</div>
    <div id="jobtitle"> Maryland women’s lacrosse beat writer </div>
    <div id="organization">The Diamondback</div>
    <div id="dates">January 2023-Present</div>
    
   <p> I published 45 articles (3-4 per week during the season) reporting on the University of Maryland’s women’s lacrosse team. The stories ranged from game recaps and previews, midweek stories, profiles, human-interest features and analysis stories. I had no lacrosse knowledge prior to getting on the beat but worked rigorously to understand the game, allowing me to succeed in the position. I gained the trust of my sources to earn great access and strong tips, as well as my editors, who trusted my ability to find nuanced angles and stories to report on.</p>
     
    <div id="jobtitle"> Sports Information Director </div>
    <div id="organization">Evanston Township High School, The Evanston Roundtable</div>
    <div id="dates">August 2022 - January 2023</div>
    
    <p>I wrote a variety of different sports stories for Evanston Township High School’s Athletic Dept., which were picked up by the local newspaper, the Evanston Roundtable.</p>
     
    <div id="jobtitle"> Maryland gymnastics beat writer </div>
    <div id="organization">The Diamondback</div>
    <div id="dates">August 2021-August 2022</div>
    <p>I learned a completely new sport and published 30 articles (2-3 per week during the season) on the University of Maryland’s gymnastics team. Oftentimes, women’s sports and non-ball sports can be written with a different tone than men’s sports and/or ball sports, but I prioritized that my writing wouldn’t be delegitimizing the sport, which is often the case.</p>
